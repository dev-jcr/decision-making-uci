## Module 1
Decision
A choice that you make about something after thinking about it: the result of deciding.

Decision Making
The thought process of selecting a logical choice from the available options

Sometimes not taking a choice might be better, if both have the same output, positive or negative.

1. Know your purpose.
2. Understand your biases.
3. Consider different consequences.

Problem
A gap ir something to change

        Pareto Charts
            80/20 Rule
            Vertical bar graph in which values are plotted in decreasing order of relative frequency from left to right.
            Shows
                Information in a descending hierarchical order
                Issues causing most problems
                The most important things
            How?
                Aggregate the most impacting identified issues and choose them to solve them. Avoid focusing on those with little impact.
            Steps
                Determine the problem categories
                Tabulate the Data
                Plot the chart

## Module 3
Group Decision Making.
    Common Methods
        Majority
            Familiar
            Fast
            Many people know how to do it
                But
                    People might be left behind
                    Decision might not be effectively implemented
                    Slow
        Minority
            Small groups can make special decisions
            The group can make more things concurrently
            Clear guidelines 
                But
                    Some members might not buy-in
        Expert
            Fast
            Easy
            Tends to accuracy
                But
                No group
                Depends on trust on it
        Authority with no input
            Fast
            Binding
                But
                    Buy-in and support depends on trust over autorithy
        Consensus and authority with input
            Group members consulted and heared
                But
                    Some decisions pre-made
                    Possible confusion about the process
            Consensus
                Group members are involved
                Solid buy-in and support
                Implementation can be very successful
                    But
                        Slow
                        Hard
